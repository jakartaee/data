== Jakarta Data Providers

A Jakarta Data provider might come as an integrated component of a Jakarta EE container, or it might be a separate component that integrates with the Jakarta EE container via standard or proprietary SPIs.
For example, a Jakarta Data provider might use a CDI portable extension to integrate with dependency injection.
The role of the Jakarta Data provider is to supply implementations of application-defined repositories.

=== Providers and Repositories

A Jakarta Data provider must supply an implementation of each repository interface which either:

- explicitly specifies the name of the provider via the `provider` member of the `@Repository` annotation, or
- does not explicitly specify a `provider`, but whose entity classes are annotated with an entity-defining annotation type supported by the provider.

The repository implementation and the Jakarta Data provider are responsible for mediating interaction between the application program and the datastore, often taking advantage of other Jakarta EE services such as datasource provisioning and transaction management.

An application usually obtains a reference to an implementation of a repository via dependency injection.
Therefore, the provider must make its repository implementations available to the bean container responsible for dependency injection.

Multiple Jakarta Data providers may coexist within a single program and provide repository implementations.
It is the responsibility of the application developer to ensure that each repository is eligible for implementation by exactly one provider, according to the rules specified below.

[NOTE]
====
If the application developer fails to disambiguate the provider for every repository in the application, the behavior is undefined by this specification.
====

=== Provider support for Entities

A Jakarta Data provider typically supports one entity-defining annotation type, but it may support multiple entity-defining annotation types.
A provider may even have no entity-defining annotation and feature a programming model for entity classes where the entity classes are unannotated.

In particular:

- The `jakarta.persistence.Entity` annotation from the Jakarta Persistence specification is an entity-defining annotation for Jakarta Data providers backed by a Jakarta Persistence provider. Other Jakarta Data providers must not support the use of `jakarta.persistence.Entity` as an entity-defining annotation.

- The `jakarta.nosql.Entity` annotation from the Jakarta NoSQL specification is an entity-defining annotation for Jakarta Data providers backed by NoSQL databases. Other Jakarta Data providers must not support the use of `jakarta.nosql.Entity` as an entity-defining annotation.

A Jakarta Data provider might define a custom entity-defining annotation.
The name of such a custom entity-defining annotation type must end with `Entity`. This convention allows any Jakarta Data provider to identify when a repository is associated with entity classes declared using an unrecognized entity-defining annotation.

The lifecycle methods and query methods of a repository operate on a set of entities associated with that repository.
All entities associated with a given repository should be declared using the same entity-defining annotation type.
If the entities associated with a given repository are declared using a mix of annotation types, the behavior is undefined by this specification.

A Jakarta Data provider must ignore every repository associated with entity classes declared using an entity-defining annotation which is available at runtime, but not recognized by the provider, allowing another Jakarta Data provider to supply the implementation.

On the other hand, if an entity class is annotated with an entity-defining annotation which is _not_ available at runtime, the Jakarta Data provider must completely ignore the annotation, and treat the entity as if that entity-defining annotation were missing.

[NOTE]
====
This allows an entity class to be compiled with multiple entity-defining annotations, each targeting a different Jakarta Data provider, and have the provider automatically disambiguated at runtime based on the availability of the entity-defining annotations.
====

=== Provider Name

The entity-defining annotation type is the preferred way to avoid conflicts between Jakarta Data providers.
But when multiple Jakarta Data providers support the same entity-defining annotation, the application must disambiguate the Jakarta Data provider for a repository by explicitly specifying the `provider` attribute of the `Repository` annotation.

A Jakarta Data provider must ignore every repository which specifies the name of a different `provider` in its `@Repository` annotation.

== Interoperability with other Jakarta EE Specifications

This section discusses interoperability with related Jakarta EE specifications. When operating within a Jakarta EE product, the availability of other Jakarta EE technologies depends on whether the Jakarta EE Core profile, Jakarta EE Web profile, or Jakarta EE Platform is used.

=== Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection

Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) is a specification in the Jakarta EE Core profile that provides a powerful and flexible dependency injection framework for Java applications. CDI provides a programming model based around decoupled components with container-managed lifecycles and container-injected dependencies, enabling loose coupling and promoting modular and reusable code.

In the Jakarta EE environment, CDI allows implementations of Jakarta Data repositories to be made available for injection via the `@Inject` annotation.

The following example illustrates this integration:

[source,java]
----
@Repository
public interface CarRepository extends BasicRepository<Car, Long> {

  List<Car> findByType(CarType type);

  Optional<Car> findByName(String name);

}
----

Here, a `CarRepository` interface extends the `BasicRepository` interface provided by Jakarta Data, which pre-defines a set of basic operations for entities, as described in <<Repositories with Built-in Supertypes>>.

The `@Repository` annotation instructs the Jakarta Data provider to:

- generate an implementation of the repository interface, as defined in <<Repository Interfaces>>, and
- make the implementation available as a CDI bean, either by registering the implementation class itself as a bean, or by registering a producer or producer factory.

The repository implementation bean must have:

- qualifier type `@Default`, and
- the repository interface as a bean type.

Thus, the implementation is eligible for injection to unqualified injection points typed to the repository interface, as defined by section 2.4 of the CDI specification, version 4.0.

NOTE: This specification does not restrict the scope of the repository implementation bean.

In our example, the repository implementation is eligible for injection to unqualified injection points of type `CarRepository`.

[source,java]
----
@Inject
CarRepository repository;

// ...

List<Car> cars = repository.findByType(CarType.SPORT);
----

This fragment shows how the application might request injection of a `CarRepository` instance using the `@Inject` annotation, and then invoke various data access methods declared or inherited by the `CarRepository` interface, such as `save()`, `findByType()`, and `findByName()`.

This integration between CDI and Jakarta Data allows for seamless management of repository instances within Jakarta EE applications.

==== CDI Extensions for Jakarta Data providers

In environments where CDI Full or CDI Lite is available, Jakarta Data providers can make use of a CDI extension--an implementation of `jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.Extension` or `jakarta.enterprise.inject.build.compatible.spi.BuildCompatibleExtension`--to discover interfaces annotated with `@Repository` and make their implementations available for injection.

NOTE: Jakarta Data does not mandate the use of a specific kind of CDI extension but places the general requirement on the Jakarta Data provider to arrange for injection of the provided repository implementation into injection points typed to the repository interface and having no qualifiers (other than `Default` or `Any`), as described above.

NOTE: CDI Lite (corresponding to Jakarta Core profile) does not include a requirement to support `jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.Extension`, which is part of CDI Full (Jakarta Web profile and Jakarta Platform). The `jakarta.enterprise.inject.build.compatible.spi.BuildCompatibleExtension` applies to both CDI Lite and CDI Full.

NOTE: Jakarta Data providers that wish to provide both extensions can use CDI's `@SkipIfPortableExtensionPresent` to prevent the `BuildCompatibleExtension` from colliding with the portable `Extension` when running in the Jakarta Web Profile or Jakarta Platform where CDI Full is present.

=== Jakarta Interceptors

A repository interface or method of a repository interface may be annotated with an interceptor binding annotation.
In the Jakarta EE environment--or in any other environment where Jakarta Interceptors is available and integrated with Jakarta CDI--if the repository implementation is instantiated by the CDI bean container then the interceptor binding annotation is inherited by the repository implementation. That is, the interceptor binding annotation must be treated as if it were placed directly on the repository implementation bean. The interceptors bound to the annotation are applied automatically by the implementation of Jakarta Interceptors.


=== Jakarta Transactions

Work performed by a repository might occur within the scope of a transaction managed by Jakarta Transactions. This is usually transparent to the code acting as client of the repository. When:

1. Jakarta Transactions is available,
2. a global transaction is active on the thread of execution in which a repository operation is called, and
3. the data source backing the repository is capable of transaction enlistment,

then the repository operation must be performed within the context of the global transaction. That is, the data source resources involved in the operation must be enlisted as participants in the transaction.

[NOTE]
====
In the Jakarta EE environment, such enlistment usually happens automatically when the repository implementation makes use of a data source which is under the management of the Jakarta EE container.
====

The repository operation must not commit or roll back a transaction which was already associated with the thread in which the repository operation was called, but it might cause the transaction to be marked for rollback if the repository operation fails, that is, it may set the transaction status to `jakarta.transaction.Status.STATUS_MARKED_ROLLBACK`.

A repository interface or method of a repository interface may be marked with the annotation `jakarta.transaction.Transactional`.
When a repository operation marked `@Transactional` is called in an environment where both Jakarta Transactions and Jakarta CDI are available, the semantics of this annotation must be observed during execution of the repository operation.

[NOTE]
====
In the Jakarta EE environment, the `@Transactional` annotation is automatically inherited by the repository implementation from the user-written repository interface, and the semantics of the `@Transactional` annotation are applied automatically by the implementation of Jakarta Interceptors supplied by the Jakarta EE container.
====

=== Jakarta Persistence

Integration with Jakarta Persistence is left undefined in this first release of Jakarta Data.

=== Jakarta NoSQL

When integrating Jakarta Data with Jakarta NoSQL, developers can use the NoSQL annotations to define the mapping of entities in repositories. Entities in Jakarta NoSQL are typically annotated with `jakarta.nosql.Entity` to indicate their suitability for persistence in NoSQL databases.

A Jakarta Data provider that supports Jakarta NoSQL will scan classes marked with the `jakarta.nosql.Entity` annotation.

By supporting Jakarta NoSQL annotations, Jakarta Data providers enable Java developers to utilize familiar and standardized mapping techniques when defining entities in repositories, ensuring compatibility and interoperability with the respective technologies.

=== Jakarta Bean Validation

Integrating with Jakarta Validation ensures data consistency within the Java layer. By applying validation rules to the data, developers can enforce constraints and business rules, preventing invalid or inconsistent information from being processed or persisted.

Using Jakarta Validation brings several advantages. It helps maintain data integrity, improves data quality, and enhances the reliability of the application. Catching validation errors early in the Java layer can identify and resolve potential issues before further processing or persistence occurs. Additionally, Jakarta Validation allows for declarative validation rules, simplifying the validation logic and promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.

In Jakarta Data, repository methods participate in method validation as defined by the section "Method and constructor validation" of the Jakarta Validation specification. Method validation includes validation of constraints on method parameters and results. The `jakarta.validation.Valid` annotation is used to opt in to cascading validation that validates constraints that are found on an object that is supplied as a parameter or returned as a result.

The following code snippet demonstrates the usage of Jakarta Validation annotations in the `Student` entity class:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Student {

    @Id
    private String id;

    @Column
    @NotBlank
    private String name;

    @Positive
    @Min(18)
    @Column
    private int age;
}
----

In this example, the `name` field is annotated with `@NotBlank`, indicating that it must not be blank. The `age` field is annotated with both `@Positive` and `@Min(18)`, ensuring it is a positive integer greater than or equal to 18.

The `School` repository interface, shown below, uses the `jakarta.validation.Valid` annotation to cause the constraints from the `Student` entity to be validated during the `save` operation, whereas the validation constraints are not applied to the `Student` entities returned as a result of the `findByAgeLessThanEqual` operation because the `findByAgeLessThanEqual` method does not include a `jakarta.validation.Valid` annotation that applies to the return value.

[source,java]
----
@Repository
public interface School extends DataRepository<Student, String> {
    @Save
    void save(@Valid Student s);

    List<Student> findByAgeLessThanEqual(@Min(18) int age);
}
----
