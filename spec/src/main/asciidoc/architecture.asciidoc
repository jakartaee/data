== Architecture

In the realm of software design, the repository pattern encapsulates the logic required to access data sources. This pattern consolidates data access functionality, offering improved maintainability and decoupling the infrastructure or technology used to access databases from the domain model layer.

The Repository pattern is a fundamental concept within Jakarta Data that plays a central role in data access and management. Essentially, a repository is a mediator between an application's domain logic and the underlying data storage, be it a relational database, NoSQL database, or any other data source.

In Jakarta Data, a Repository provides a structured and organized way to interact with data. It abstracts data storage and retrieval complexities, allowing you to work with domain-specific objects and perform common operations on data without writing low-level database queries.

As employed in Jakarta Data, the Repository pattern exhibits several key characteristics that make it a powerful tool for managing data access within Java applications. These characteristics collectively define how repositories function within Jakarta Data, providing a structured and domain-centric approach to working with data. These key characteristics offer insight into how repositories simplify data access and enhance the maintainability of code.

- **Abstraction:** Repositories abstract the details of how data is stored, enabling the developer to focus on the application's domain logic without being tightly coupled to a specific database technology.

- **Structured Data Access:** Jakarta Data repositories offer a structured and consistent way to perform data access operations. This structured approach ensures that the codebase remains organized and maintainable.

- **Domain-Centric:** Repositories are designed to be domain-centric, aligning with the application's domain model. It means that data access operations are closely tied to business entities, making code more intuitive and expressive.

In summary, the Repository pattern in Jakarta Data offers a structured and domain-centric approach to data access, providing a balance between abstraction and ease of use. It simplifies data access by encapsulating the details of the data source while aligning closely with the application's domain model. It makes it a valuable choice for many Java developers, especially in projects where a clean separation of concerns and maintainable codebase are essential.

=== Repositories in Jakarta Data

Within the context of Jakarta Data, the repository plays a pivotal role in simplifying data access for various persistence stores. The repository is a Java interface that acts as a gateway for accessing persistent data of one or more entity types. Repositories offer a streamlined approach to working with data by exposing operations for querying, retrieving, and modifying entity class instances that represent data in the persistent store.

Several characteristics define repositories:

- **Reduced Boilerplate Code:** One of the primary goals of a repository abstraction is to significantly reduce the boilerplate code required to implement data access layers for diverse persistence stores. This reduction in repetitive code enhances code maintainability and developer productivity.

- **Jakarta Data Annotations:** In Jakarta Data, repositories are defined as interfaces and are annotated with the `@Repository` annotation. This annotation serves as a marker to indicate that the interface represents a repository.

- **Built-In Interfaces:** The Jakarta Data specification provides a set of built-in interfaces from which repositories can inherit. These built-in interfaces offer a convenient way to include a variety of pre-defined methods for common operations. They also declare the entity type to use for methods where the entity type cannot otherwise be inferred.

- **Data Retrieval and Modification:** Repositories facilitate data retrieval and modification operations. This includes querying for persistent instances in the data store, creating new persistent instances in the data store, removing existing persistent instances, and modifying the state of persistent instances. Conventionally, these operations are named insert, update, save and delete for modifying operations and find, count, and exists for retrieval operations.

- **Subset of Data:** Repositories may expose only a subset of the full data set available in the data store, providing a focused and controlled access point to the data.

- **Entity Associations:** Entities within a repository may have associations between them, especially in the case of relational data access. However, this specification does not define the semantics of associations between entities belonging to different repositories.

- **Stateless Repositories:** Repositories are stateless. This specification does not address the definition of repositories that externalize Jakarta Persistence-style stateful persistence contexts.

Repositories in Jakarta Data serve as efficient gateways for managing and interacting with persistent data, offering a simplified and consistent approach to data access and modification within Java applications.

The application must provide the following when using repositories in Jakarta Data:

1. **Entity Classes and Mappings:** Developers define a set of entity classes and mappings tailored to a specific data store. These entities represent the data structure and schema, offering a powerful means to interact with the underlying data.

2. **Repository Interfaces:** Jakarta Data enables the creation of one or more repository interfaces, following predefined rules that include the guidelines set forth by this specification. These interfaces are the gateways to accessing and manipulating the data, offering a structured and efficient way to perform data operations.

An implementation of Jakarta Data, specifically tailored to the chosen data store, assumes the responsibility of implementing each repository interface. This symbiotic relationship between developers and Jakarta Data ensures that data access and manipulation remain consistent, efficient, and aligned with best practices.

Jakarta Data empowers developers to shape their data access strategies by defining entity classes and repositories, with implementations seamlessly adapting to the chosen data store. This flexibility and Jakarta Data's persistence-agnostic approach promote robust data management within Java applications.

The Jakarta Data specification supports two basic ways to define a repository interface:

- by extending one of the generic repository supertype interfaces defined by Jakarta Data, or
- by annotating the methods of an interface which does _not_ extend any built-in supertype.

A Java developer creates an interface, marks it with the `@Repository` annotation, and has the option to extend one or more built-in generic repository interfaces, or to annotate its lifecycle methods.

NOTE: Jakarta Data allows applications to intermix the two approaches by defining methods annotated with `@Insert`, `@Update`, `@Delete`, or `@Save` on repositories which inherit the built-in supertypes.

==== Repositories with Built-in Supertypes

Jakarta Data defines a hierarchy of built-in interfaces which user-defined repositories may inherit. At the root of this hierarchy is the `DataRepository` interface. A repository is permitted to extend one or more of the members of the hierarchy, or none at all. When a repository extends a built-in interface, the implementation of every method inherited from the built-in interface must preserve the semantics specified by the built-in interface.

....

A repository which extends a built-in supertype usually acts as a home for operations acting on a single entity type called the _primary entity type_ of the repository.
The primary entity type is determined by the argument to the first generic type variable of the generic supertype.

- The `BasicRepository` interface includes some of the most common operations applying to a single type of entity, including `save()`, `delete()`, and `findById()`.

- The `CrudRepository` interface inherits `BasicRepository`, adding `insert()` and `update()` methods corresponding to the Create and Update operations of the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) pattern.

Given a `Product` entity with ID of type `long`, the repository could be as simple as:

[source,java]
----
@Repository
public interface ProductRepository extends BasicRepository<Product, Long> {

}
----


There is no nomenclature restriction requiring the `Repository` suffix. For example, a repository for the `Car` entity does not need to be named `CarRepository`. It could be named `Cars`, `Vehicles`, or even `Garage`.

[source,java]
----
@Repository
public interface Garage extends BasicRepository<Car, String> {

}
----

==== Repositories without Built-in Supertypes

Alternatively, Jakarta Data allows a custom repository interface which does not extend any built-in type. This option:

- provides the developer with complete control over the operations available, and over their naming, and
- allows a single repository to declare operations acting on a family of related entities, instead of being limited to just one entity type.

In this approach, database operations involving fundamental data changes, such as insertion, update, and removal, are realized via the use of lifecycle annotations like `@Insert`, `@Update`, `@Delete`, and `@Save`. These annotations enable the crafting of expressive and contextually meaningful repository methods, resulting in a repository API that closely mirrors the semantics of the domain.

For instance, consider the `Garage` repository interface below:

[source,java]
----
@Repository
public interface Garage {

    @Insert
    Car park(Car car);

    @Delete
    void unpark(Car car);
}
----

Notice that the `@Insert` annotation is used to declare the `park()` method.

The previous example illustrates the design of a repository interface which captures some of the essence of the business domain. This approach fosters a shared understanding and more intuitive communication within the development team, with database operations named according to the language of the domain.

=== Querying in Jakarta Data

Jakarta Data provides two core ways to express queries:

- <<Parameter-based automatic query methods,parameter-based automatic query methods>>, that is, `@Find` and `@Delete`, and
- <<Annotated query methods,annotated query methods>>, that is `@Query` and <<Jakarta Data Query Language>> or Jakarta Persistence Query Language.

Newly written code should use these approaches.
A typical application based on Jakarta Data uses a mix of both approaches, with the choice of approach depending on the complexity of the query.

As an extension to the core specification, Jakarta Data 1.0 offers a Query by Method Name facility to provide a migration path for existing applications written for repository frameworks which offer similar functionality.
Query by Method name is described in a companion document to this specification.

A Jakarta Data provider is required to support the Query by Method Name extension in Jakarta Data 1.0.
This requirement will be removed in a future version of Jakarta Data.
