== Portability in Jakarta Data

Jakarta Data offers varying degrees of portability depending on the database and capabilities used. A subset of function is standardized across all database types, while other subsets of function are standardized only for the specific types of databases to which the capability pertains. These requirements are explicitly called out in documentation throughout the specification, such as the "Unavailable In" column of the tables of repository keywords in the Jakarta Data module Javadoc. The Jakarta Data specification levies requirements against applications and Jakarta Data providers, but not against databases. The Jakarta Data specification requires the Jakarta Data provider to offer function to the extent that the database is capable and to raise an exception where the database is not capable. It is not the aim of Jakarta Data to offer the ability to switch between different databases, but to standardize a common starting point for data access from which capability that is specific to the various types of databases is able to build upon.

The portability that is offered by Jakarta Data pertains to usage of the Jakarta Data API by application code, enabling application code that restricts itself to the Jakarta Data API to remain the same when used with any Jakarta Data provider running against the same database. Jakarta Data relies on external persistence specifications such as Jakarta Persistence and Jakarta NoSQL to standardize entity models. Jakarta Data does not place any requirements on the format of data to make persisted data and other database artifacts portable across providers. Jakarta Data does not offer any means to migrate data that is persisted by one provider to a form that is usable by another provider.

=== Portability for relational databases

A Jakarta Data provider backed by access to relational data must support the built-in lifecycle annotations `@Insert`, `@Update`, and `@Delete`, along with the built-in repository types `BasicRepository` and `CrudRepository`. It must also fully support Jakarta Data query methods, including pagination, ordering, and limiting, subject to the caveat that follows.

[NOTE]
====
The SQL dialect and the database set limits on what operations are implementable.
A Jakarta Data provider is not required to supply an implementation of a repository which declares query methods mapping to operations which are not supported by the database itself.
====

If the provider is backed by JDBC, it should support resource accessor methods of type `java.sql.Connection`.

=== Portability for NoSQL databases

Portability in Jakarta Data extends to various NoSQL databases, each presenting unique challenges and capabilities. Jakarta Data aims to provide a consistent experience across these NoSQL database types. This section covers the key portability aspects for four categories of NoSQL databases: key-value, wide-column, document, and graph databases.

==== Key-value Databases

Key-value databases resemble dictionaries or Maps in Java, where data is primarily accessed using a key. In such databases, queries unrelated to keys are typically limited. To ensure a minimum level of support, Jakarta Data mandates the implementation of `BasicRepository` built-in methods that require an identifier or a key. However, the deleteAll and count methods are not required. Methods relying on complex queries, which are defined as queries that do not use the Key or identifier, raise `java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException` due to the fundamental nature of key-value databases.

IMPORTANT: For any NoSQL database type not covered here, such as time series databases, the Key-value support serves as the minimum required level of compatibility.

==== Wide-column databases

Wide-column databases offer more query flexibility, even allowing the use of secondary indexes, albeit potentially impacting performance. When interacting with wide-column databases, Jakarta Data requires the implementation of the `BasicRepository` along with all of its methods. However, developers should be mindful that certain query keywords, such as "And" or "Or," may not be universally supported in these databases. The full set of required keywords is documented in the section of the Jakarta Data module Javadoc that is titled "Reserved Keywords for Query by Method Name".

==== Document databases

Document databases provide query flexibility akin to relational databases, offering robust query capabilities. They encourage denormalization for performance optimization. When interfacing with document databases, Jakarta Data goes a step further by supporting both built-in repositories: `BasicRepository` and `CrudRepository`. Additionally, Query by Method Name is available, though developers should be aware that some keywords may not be universally supported.  The full set of required keywords is documented in the section of the Jakarta Data module Javadoc that is titled "Reserved Keywords for Query by Method Name".

These portability considerations reflect Jakarta Data's commitment to providing a consistent data access experience across diverse NoSQL database types. While specific capabilities and query support may vary, Jakarta Data aims to simplify data access, promoting flexibility and compatibility in NoSQL database interactions.

==== Graph databases

A Graph database, a specialized NoSQL variant, excels in managing intricate data relationships, rivaling traditional relational databases. Its unique strength lies in its ability to handle both directed and undirected edges (or relationships) between vertices (or nodes) and store entity attributes on both vertices and edges.

Graph databases excel at answering queries that return rows containing flat objects, collections, or a combination of flat objects and connections. However, portability is only guaranteed when mapping rows to classes, and when queries specified via annotations or other supported means are used. It should be noted that queries derived from keywords and combinations of mapped classes/attributes will be translated into vendor-specific queries.

It is important to note that in Jakarta Data the Graph database supports the built-in repositories: `BasicRepository` and `DataRepository`. Additionally, Query by Method Name is available, though developers should be aware that some keywords may not be universally supported. The full set of required keywords is documented in the section of the Jakarta Data module Javadoc that is titled "Reserved Keywords for Query by Method Name".
