== Introduction

The Jakarta Data specification provides an API to simplify data access. It enables the
Java developer to focus on the data model, while delegating away the complexities of data persistence.
To make this possible, Jakarta Data includes a variety of features such as
pre-built interfaces for data access, offset and cursor based pagination strategies,
and the ability to compose custom query methods that the framework implements.

Data is a primary concern of most applications, and dealing with a database presents one of the most significant challenges within software architecture. Beyond selecting from the various database options available in the market, it is necessary to consider the intricacies of persistence integrations. Jakarta Data simplifies the lives of Java developers by providing a solution that streamlines data access and manipulation.

In this context, a domain-centric approach refers to designing the application's architecture primarily focusing on the domain model. It means that the application's data and logic structure and organization revolve around the core domain concepts and business rules, ensuring that the domain model plays a central role in shaping the application's structure.

=== Goals

Jakarta Data addresses a fundamental challenge in Java application development: the seamless integration of diverse data sources amid the dissimilarities in their respective programming models. Offering the Java developer a common, familiar starting point for data access is helpful for solutions involving multiple databases and storage technologies.

The primary problem Jakarta Data sets out to solve is the complexity and inconsistency that arises when Java applications encounter various database systems—relational, document, column, key-value, graph, and others. Managing these diverse data sources can be daunting, often requiring developers to write specialized code for each storage technology.

Jakarta Data combines the concept of a persistence agnostic API with a domain-centric approach. This approach enables developers to work with different databases and storage engines while aligning their data access strategies with the core principles of a domain-centric architecture, where the domain model plays a central role in shaping the application's structure.

Jakarta Data is guided by a set of clear and well-defined objectives to simplify data integration and enhance data access for Java developers. These objectives serve as the pillars of its design philosophy, ensuring that it addresses real-world challenges and provides concrete advantages to developers:

* **Jakarta Data is engineered to tackle a fundamental problem:** simplifying data access and manipulation within Java applications that interact with diverse databases and storage sources.

* **Jakarta Data is designed to be persistence agnostic:** In this context, agnostic does not mean that you can switch the underlying persistence without changes but implies that Jakarta Data is not tied to a specific database technology. It offers a flexible, adaptable framework that allows you to work with the databases and storage sources that best suit your project's needs. This agnostic approach ensures that Jakarta Data can cater to various use cases.

* **Enhancing a Domain-Centric Approach:** Jakarta Data enhances the concept of a persistence agnostic API by incorporating a domain-centric approach. It enables developers to align their data access strategies with the core principles of a domain-centric architecture, where the domain model plays a central role in shaping the application's structure.

* **Unified API:** Jakarta Data provides a unified and standardized API for interacting with various data sources. This consistency simplifies development by allowing developers to use the same tools and practices regardless of the underlying database technology.

* **Pluggable and Extensible:** Jakarta Data is designed to be pluggable and extensible. Even in cases where the API doesn't directly support a specific behavior of a storage engine, Jakarta Data aims to provide an extensible API to enable developers to customize and adapt as needed.

* **Simplified and Domain-Centric Querying and Database Operations:** Jakarta Data strongly emphasizes simplifying and aligning querying and database operations with your application's domain model. By offering domain-centric query capabilities through annotations, built-in repository interfaces, or query-by-method, Jakarta Data strives to be compatible with multiple databases and inherently closer to your application's domain logic. This approach ensures that your queries and operations are more versatile across various persistence engines, making working with different data sources easier while maintaining a cohesive and domain-focused codebase.

* **Seamless Integration:** Jakarta Data enables seamless integration between Java applications and various persistence layers, making it easier for developers to work with different databases and storage sources without extensive customization.

=== Non-Goals

The following are not goals of Jakarta Data:

1. **Specific Features of Jakarta Persistence, Jakarta NoSQL, etc., and Specializations:** Jakarta Data does not intend to replicate or replace the specific features provided by other Jakarta specifications, such as Jakarta Persistence and Jakarta NoSQL, along with their associated specializations and extensions. These specifications have well-defined scopes and functionalities that cater to specific use cases. Jakarta Data operates with the understanding that it complements these specifications by providing a higher-level, agnostic API. It does not seek to duplicate their capabilities but aims to simplify data access and integration across diverse data sources.

2. **Replacement of Jakarta Persistence or Jakarta NoSQL Specifications:** Jakarta Data's primary goal is not to replace or supersede the Jakarta Persistence or Jakarta NoSQL specifications. Instead, it works in harmony with these specifications, serving as an additional layer that abstracts the complexities of data access. Jakarta Data enhances the developer experience by offering a persistence-agnostic approach while leveraging the capabilities of Jakarta Persistence and Jakarta NoSQL. Its role is to complement and simplify, not replace, these established specifications.

=== Conventions

The term _entity attribute_, and in some places _persistent attribute_, is used through the Jakarta Data specification to refer to a field or property of an `Entity` that is persisted to a data store. The Jakarta Persistence specification also uses these terms, as well as the term _persistent fields and properties_, which has the same meaning. Additionally, the Jakarta Data specification sometimes refers to an entity attribute by its name. For example, the `price` attribute of the `Product` entity. In other cases, an entity attribute is referred to by what it represents. For example, an entity's `Id` attribute or `Version` attribute.
