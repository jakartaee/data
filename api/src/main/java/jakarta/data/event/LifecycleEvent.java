/**
 * <p>Abstract supertype of events relating to lifecycle methods.</p>
 * <p>In Jakarta EE, a bean may observe such events via CDI:</p>
 * <pre>
 * void onInsertBook(&#64;Observes PostInsertEvent&lt;Book&gt; bookInsertion) {
 *     Book book = bookInsertion.entity();
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>As usual for a CDI event, an observer of a {@code LifecycleEvent}
 * is notified synchronously and immediately by default. An observer may
 * elect to receive notifications during a phase of the transaction
 * completion cycle by explicitly specifying a {@code TransactionPhase},
 * for example:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code @Observes(during=BEFORE_COMPLETION)} to be notified just
 *     before transaction completion, or</li>
 * <li>{@code @Observes(during=AFTER_SUCCESS)} to be notified after
 *     successful completion of the transaction.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>An observer may choose to be notified asynchronously using
 * {@code @ObservesAsync}. However, the mutable state held by the
 * {@link #entity} is not in general safe for concurrent access,
 * and so portable applications must not use {@code @ObservesAsync}
 * to observe a {@code LifecycleEvent}. If the state of an entity is
 * accessed from an asynchronous observer method for a lifecycle
 * event, the resulting behavior is undefined and unportable.</p>
 *
 *
 * @param <E> the entity type

     * The entity which is being processed by the lifecycle method.
     * <ul>
     * <li>For a {@code Pre} event, this is always the instance
     *     which was passed as an argument to the lifecycle
     *     method, and its state reflects the state of the
     *     entity before execution of the lifecycle method.</li>
     * <li>For a {@code Post} event, it may or may not be
     *     identical to the object passed as an argument
     *     to the lifecycle method, and it may or may not be
     *     identical to the instance returned by the lifecycle
     *     method, if any. If the state of the entity changes
     *     as a result of execution of the lifecycle method,
     *     those changes may or may not be reflected in the
     *     entity returned by this method.</li>

     * <p>
     * Thus, a portable application should not assume that the
     * state of the entity in a {@code Post} event faithfully
     * reflects the current state of the corresponding record
     * in the database.
     * <p>
     * A portable application must not mutate the state of the
     * entity instance returned by this method. If the state
     * of the entity instance is mutated while event listeners
     * are being notified, the resulting behavior is undefined
     * and unportable.
