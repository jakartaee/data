 * do not have awareness of a total number of pages or results. Page numbers
 * and total numbers of pages and results cannot be accurately known
 * with keyset pagination, which allows entities to be added and removed
 * in between traversal of slices or pages. When keyset pagination is used,
 * these values should not be relied upon.</p>
