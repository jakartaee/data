/**
 * <p>Keyset pagination is a form of pagination that aims to reduce the
 * possibility of missed or duplicate results by making the request for
 * each subsequent page relative to the observed values of entity properties
 * from the current page. This list of values is referred to as the keyset
 * and only includes values of entity properties that are in the sort criteria
 * of the repository method. The combination of sort criteria must uniquely
 * identify each entity. The keyset values can be from the last entity
 * (for pagination in a forward direction) or first entity on the page
 * (if requesting pages in a reverse direction),
 * or can be any other desired list of values which serve as a new starting
 * point. Keyset pagination also has the potential to improve performance
 * by avoiding the fetching and ordering of results from prior pages
 * because these become non-matching.</p>
 *
 * <p>To use keyset pagination, define a repository method with return value of
 * {@link KeysetAwareSlice} or {@link KeysetAwarePage} and which accepts a
 * special parameter (after the normal query parameters) that is a
 * {@link Pageable}. For example,</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;OrderBy("lastName")
 * &#64;OrderBy("firstName")
 * &#64;OrderBy("id")
 * KeysetAwareSlice&lt;Employee&gt; findByHoursWorkedGreaterThan(int hours, Pageable pagination);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>You can use a normal {@link Pageable} to request an initial page,</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * page = employees.findByHoursWorkedGreaterThan(1500, Pageable.ofSize(50));
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>For subsequent pages, you can request pagination relative to the
 * end of the current page as follows,</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * page = employees.findByHoursWorkedGreaterThan(1500, page.nextPageable());
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Because the page is keyset aware, the {@link Pageable}
 * that it returns from the call to {@link KeysetAwareSlice#nextPageable}
 * above is based upon a keyset from that page to use as a starting point
 * after which the results for the next page are to be found.</p>
 *
 * <p>You can also construct a {@link Pageable} with a {@link Pageable.Cursor Cursor} directly, which
 * allows you to make it relative to a specific list of values. The number and
 * order of values must match that of the
 * {@link Pageable#sortBy(Sort...)} or {@link Pageable#sortBy(Iterable)} parameters,
 * or <code>OrderBy</code> name pattern of the repository method.
 * For example,</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Employee emp = ...
 * Pageable pagination = Pageable.ofSize(50).afterKeyset(emp.lastName, emp.firstName, emp.id);
 * page = employees.findByHoursWorkedGreaterThan(1500, pagination);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>By making the query for the next page relative to observed values,
 * not a numerical position, keyset pagination is less vulnerable to changes
 * that are made to data in between page requests. Adding or removing entities
 * is possible without causing unexpected missed or duplicate results.
 * Keyset pagination does not prevent misses and duplicates if the entity
 * properties which are the sort criteria for existing entities are modified
 * or if an entity is re-added with different sort criteria after having
 * previously been removed.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Keyset Pagination with &#64;Query</h2>
 *
 * <p>Keyset pagination involves generating and appending to the query
 * additional query conditions for the keyset properties. In order for that to
 * be possible, a user-provided
 * <a href="https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-tutorial/#full-query-language-syntax">JPQL</a>
 * query must end with a
 * <code>WHERE</code> clause to which additional conditions can be appended.
 * Enclose the entire conditional expression of the <code>WHERE</code> clause
 * in parenthesis.
 * Sort criteria must be specified independently from the user-provided query,
 * either with the
 * {@link Pageable#sortBy(Sort...)} or {@link Pageable#sortBy(Iterable)} parameters.
 * For example,</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Query("SELECT o FROM Customer o WHERE (o.ordersPlaced &gt;= ?1 OR o.totalSpent &gt;= ?2)")
 * &#64;OrderBy("zipcode")
 * &#64;OrderBy("birthYear")
 * &#64;OrderBy("id")
 * KeysetAwareSlice&lt;Customer&gt; getTopBuyers(int minOrders, float minSpent, Pageable pagination);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Page Numbers and Totals</h2>
 *
 * <p>Page numbers, total numbers of elements across all pages, and total
 * count of pages are not accurate when keyset pagination is used and should
 * not be relied upon.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Database Support for Keyset Pagination</h2>
 *
 * <p>A repository method with return type of <code>KeysetAwareSlice</code> or
 * {@link KeysetAwarePage} must raise {@link UnsupportedOperationException}
 * if the database is incapable of keyset pagination.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of elements in this slice

     * when matching entities are added prior to the first page and the
     * previous page is requested) by assigning a page number of <code>1</code>

     * numbered <code>1</code> and that
