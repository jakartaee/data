/**
 * <p>Annotates a repository method to specify a query string such as SQL, JPQL, Cypher etc. to execute.</p>
 *
 * <p>Jakarta Data providers for relational databases must support
 * JPQL queries if backed by a Jakarta Persistence provider,
 * and otherwise must support SQL queries.</p>
 *
 * <p>The query language can used named parameters or positional parameters.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Named parameters</b> are referred to by name within the query language.
 * The {@link Param} annotation annotates method parameters to bind them to a named parameter name.
 * The {@code Param} annotation is unnecessary for named parameters when the method parameter name
 * matches the query language named parameter name and the application is compiled with the
 * {@code -parameters} compiler option that makes parameter names available
 * at run time. When the {@code Param} annotation is not used, the Jakarta Data provider must
 * interpret the query by scanning for the delimiter that is used for positional parameters.
 * If the delimiter appears for another purpose in a query that requries named parameters,
 * it might be necessary for the application to explictly define the {@code Param} in order to
 * disambiguate.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Positional parameters</b> are referred to by a number that corresponds to the
 * numerical position, starting with 1, of the repository method parameters.</p>
 *
 * <p>For example,</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Repository}
 * public interface People extends CrudRepository{@code <Person, Long>} {
 *
 *     // JPQL using positional parameters
 *     {@code @Query("SELECT p from Person p WHERE (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM p.birthday) = ?1)")}
 *     {@code List<Person>} bornIn(int year);
 *
 *     // JPQL using named parameters
 *     {@code @Query("SELECT DISTINCT p.name from Person p WHERE (LENGTH(p.name) >= :min AND LENGTH(p.name) <= :max)")}
 *     {@code List<String>} namesOfLength({@code @Param}("min") int minLength,
 *                                {@code @Param}("max") int minLength,
 *                                Sort... sorts);
 *
 *     ...
 * }
