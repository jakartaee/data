/**
 * <p>A built-in repository supertype for performing basic operations on entities.</p>
 *
 * <p>The type parameters of {@code BasicRepository<T,K>} capture the primary entity type ({@code T}) for the repository
 * and the type of the unique identifier attribute ({@code K}) of the primary entity type.</p>
 *
 * <p>The primary entity type is used for repository methods, such as {@code countBy...} and {@code deleteBy...}, which
 * do not explicitly specify an entity type.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example entity:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Entity}
 * public class Employee {
 *     {@code @Id}
 *     public int badgeNumber;
 *     public String firstName;
 *     public String lastName;
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Example repository:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Repository}
 * public interface Employees extends BasicRepository{@code <Employee, Integer>} {
 *
 *     boolean deleteByBadgeNumber(int badgeNum);
 *
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Inject}
 * Employees employees;
 *
 * ...
 *
 * Employee emp = ...
 * emp = employees.save(emp);
 *
 * boolean deleted = employees.deleteByBadgeNumber(emp.badgeNum);
 *
 * PageRequest{@code <Employee>} pageRequest = PageRequest.of(Employee.class).size(25).sortBy(Sort.asc("name"));
 * Page{@code <Employee>} page = people.findAll(pageRequest);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The module Javadoc provides an {@link jakarta.data/ overview} of Jakarta Data.</p>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the primary entity class of the repository.
 * @param <K> the type of the unique identifier attribute of the primary entity.
