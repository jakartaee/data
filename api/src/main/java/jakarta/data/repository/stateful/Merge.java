/**
 * <p>Lifecycle annotation for repository methods of stateful repositories
 * which perform merge operations. The {@code Merge} annotation must
 * not be applied to a method of a stateless repository.
 * </p>
 * <p>The {@code Merge} annotation indicates that the annotated repository
 * method copies the state of one of more unmanaged entities to managed
 * entities belonging to the current persistence context associated with the
 * repository. The merge might change the persistent state of the managed
 * entities, and might cause that state to be inserted or updated in the
 * database. This typically occurs later, when the persistence context is
 * flushed.
 * </p>
 * <p>A {@code Merge} method accepts an instance or instances of an entity
 * class. The method must have exactly one parameter whose type is either:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>the class of the entity to be inserted, or</li>
 *     <li>{@code List<E>} or {@code E[]} where {@code E} is the class of the
 *     entities to be inserted.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>The annotated method must have a return type that is the same as the
 * type of its parameter.
 * </p>
 * <p>If an instance passed to the method is already managed, the call has no
 * effect, and the method just returns the argument entity. Otherwise, if the
 * instance is unmanaged, the method returns a managed entity instance which
 * must be distinct from the argument entity, but which holds the same
 * persistent state.
 * </p>
 * <p>Every Jakarta Data provider which supports stateful repositories is
 * required to accept a {@code Merge} method which conforms to this signature.
 * Application of the {@code Merge} annotation to a method with any other
 * signature is not portable between Jakarta Data providers. Furthermore,
 * support for stateful repositories is optional. A Jakarta Data provider is
 * not required to support stateful repositories.
 * </p>
 * <p>An event of type {@link jakarta.data.event.PreInsertEvent} must be
 * raised before each record is inserted in the database. An event of type
 * {@link jakarta.data.event.PostInsertEvent} must be raised after each record
 * is successfully inserted. Similarly, an event of type
 * {@link jakarta.data.event.PreUpdateEvent} must be raised before each record
 * is updated. An event of type {@link jakarta.data.event.PostUpdateEvent}
 * must be raised after each record is successfully updated.
 * </p>
 * <p>Annotations such as {@code @Find}, {@code @Query}, {@code @Persist},
 * {@code @Merge}, {@code @Remove}, and {@code @Refresh} are mutually-exclusive.
 * A given method of a repository interface may have at most one {@code @Find}
 * annotation, lifecycle annotation, or query annotation.
 * </p>
