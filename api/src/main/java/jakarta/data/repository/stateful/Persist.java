/**
 * <p>Lifecycle annotation for repository methods of stateful repositories
 * which perform persist operations. The {@code Persist} annotation must
 * not be applied to a method of a stateless repository.
 * </p>
 * <p>The {@code Persist} annotation indicates that the annotated repository
 * method makes one or more entities managed, adding them to the current
 * persistence context associated with the repository, and schedules the
 * entities for insertion in the database. Insertion might occur immediately,
 * when the annotated repository method is invoked, or it might occur later,
 * when the persistence context is flushed.
 * </p>
 * <p>An {@code Persist} method accepts an instance or instances of an entity
 * class. The method must have exactly one parameter whose type is either:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>the class of the entity to be persisted, or</li>
 *     <li>{@code List<E>} or {@code E[]} where {@code E} is the class of the
 *     entities to be persisted.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>The annotated method must be declared {@code void}.
 * </p>
 * <p>If an instance passed to the {@code Persist} method is already managed,
 * the call has no effect unless the instance was previously scheduled for
 * deletion via a call to a {@link Remove} method. If the instance was
 * scheduled for deletion, then the {@code Persist} method undoes the effect
 * of the {@code Remove} method.
 * </p>
 * <p>Every Jakarta Data provider which supports stateful repositories is
 * required to accept a {@code Persist} method which conforms to this signature.
 * Application of the {@code Persist} annotation to a method with any other
 * signature is not portable between Jakarta Data providers. Furthermore,
 * support for stateful repositories is optional. A Jakarta Data provider
 * is not required to support stateful repositories.
 * </p>
 * <p>An event of type {@link jakarta.data.event.PreInsertEvent} must be
 * raised before each record is inserted in the database. An event of type
 * {@link jakarta.data.event.PostInsertEvent} must be raised after each record
 * is successfully inserted.
 * </p>
 * <p>Annotations such as {@code @Find}, {@code @Query}, {@code @Persist},
 * {@code @Merge}, {@code @Remove}, and {@code @Refresh} are mutually-exclusive.
 * A given method of a repository interface may have at most one {@code @Find}
 * annotation, lifecycle annotation, or query annotation.
 * </p>
