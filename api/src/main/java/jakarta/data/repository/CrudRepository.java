/**
 * <p>A built-in repository supertype for performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.</p>
 *
 * <p>This repository extends the {@link BasicRepository} interface, adding {@linkplain #insert} and {@linkplain #update}
 * operations in addition to basic {@linkplain #findById retrieval} and {@linkplain #delete deletion}. This interface
 * combines the Data Access Object (DAO) aspect with the repository pattern, offering a versatile and complete solution
 * for managing persistent entities within Java applications.</p>
 *
 * <p>The type parameters of {@code CrudRepository<T,K>} capture the primary entity type ({@code T}) for the repository
 * and the type of the unique identifier attribute ({@code K}) of the primary entity type.</p>
 *
 * <p>The primary entity type is used for repository methods, such as {@code countBy...} and {@code deleteBy...}, which
 * do not explicitly specify an entity type.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example entity:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Entity}
 * public class Cars {
 *     {@code @Id}
 *     public long vin;
 *     public String make;
 *     public String model;
 *     public int year;
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Example repository:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Repository}
 * public interface Cars extends CrudRepository{@code <Car, Long>} {
 *
 *     List{@code <Car>} findByMakeAndModel(String make, String model, {@code Sort<?>...} sorts);
 *
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Inject}
 * Cars cars;
 *
 * ...
 *
 * Car car1 = ...
 * car1 = cars.insert(car1);
 *
 * List{@code <Car>} found = findByMakeAndModel(car1.make,
 *                                      car1.model,
 *                                      Sort.desc("year"),
 *                                      Sort.asc("vin"));
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The module Javadoc provides an {@link jakarta.data/ overview} of Jakarta Data.</p>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the primary entity class of the repository.
 * @param <K> the type of the unique identifier field of property of the primary entity.
