 * <p>A slice contains the data that is retrieved for a page request.

 * For example,</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Find}
 * {@code Slice<Vehicle>} search({@code @By("make")} String make,
 *                       {@code @By("model")} String model,

 *                       {@code PageRequest<?>} pageRequest);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Unlike {@link Page}, a {@code Slice} does not have awareness of the total number of pages
 * that can be retrieved for the query.</p>
 *
 * <p>The lowercase terms, <i>slice</i> and <i>page</i>, are used interchangeably
 * throughout this specification. Wherever a distinction needs to be made between them,
 * the class name, {@code Slice} or {@code Page}, is used.</p>
