/**
 * <p>A page of data retrieved to satisfy a given page request, with a
 * {@linkplain PageRequest.Cursor cursor} for each result on the page.
 * A repository method which returns the type {@code CursoredPage} uses
 * <em>cursor-based pagination</em> to determine page boundaries.</p>
 *
 * <p>Compared to offset-based pagination, cursor-based pagination reduces
 * the possibility of missed or duplicate results when records are
 * inserted, deleted, or updated in the database between page requests.
 * Cursor-based pagination is possible when a query result set has a
 * well-defined total order, that is, when the results are sorted by a
 * list of entity fields which forms a unique key on the result set.
 * This list of entity fields must be the entity fields of the combined
 * sort criteria of the repository method, in the same order of
 * precedence. This could just be the identifier field of the
 * entity, or it might be some other combination of fields which uniquely
 * identifies each query result.</p>
 *
 * <p>When cursor-based pagination is used, a
 * {@linkplain #nextPageRequest next} page request is made relative
 * to the last entity of the current page and a
 * {@linkplain #previousPageRequest previous} page request is made relative
 * to the first entity of the current page. Alternatively, a page request might
 * be made relative to an arbitrary starting point in the result set, that
 * is, with an arbitrary value of the key.</p>
 *
 * <p>The key for a given element of the result set is represented by an
 * instance of {@link jakarta.data.page.PageRequest.Cursor Cursor}.</p>
 *
 * <p>To use cursor-based pagination, declare a repository method with return
 * type {@code CursoredPage} and with a special parameter (after the normal
 * query parameters) of type {@link PageRequest}, for example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;OrderBy("lastName")
 * &#64;OrderBy("firstName")
 * &#64;OrderBy("id")
 * CursoredPage&lt;Employee&gt; findByHoursWorkedGreaterThan(int hours, {@code PageRequest<Employee>} pageRequest);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>In initial page may be requested using an offset-based page request:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * page = employees.findByHoursWorkedGreaterThan(1500, PageRequest.of(Employee.class).size(50));
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The next page may be requested relative to the end of the current page,
 * as follows:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * page = employees.findByHoursWorkedGreaterThan(1500, page.nextPageRequest());
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Here, the instance of {@link PageRequest} returned by
 * {@link CursoredPage#nextPageRequest()} is based on a key value encapsulated
 * in an instance of {@link PageRequest.Cursor Cursor} and identifying the last
 * result on the current page.</p>
 *
 * <p>A {@link PageRequest} based on an explicit key may be constructed by
 * calling {@link PageRequest#afterKey(Object...)}. The arguments supplied
 * to this method must match the list of sorting criteria specified by
 * {@link OrderBy} annotations of the repository method, {@link Sort}
 * parameters of the page request, or <code>OrderBy</code> name pattern of
 * the repository method. For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Employee emp = ...
 * {@code PageRequest<Employee>} pageRequest = PageRequest.of(Employee.class)
 *                                                .size(50)
 *                                                .afterKey(emp.lastName, emp.firstName, emp.id);
 * page = employees.findByHoursWorkedGreaterThan(1500, pageRequest);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>By making the query for the next page relative to observed values,
 * not a numerical position, cursor-based pagination is less vulnerable to changes
 * that are made to data in between page requests. Adding or removing entities
 * is possible without causing unexpected missed or duplicate results.
 * Cursor-based pagination does not prevent misses and duplicates if the entity
 * properties which are the sort criteria for existing entities are modified
 * or if an entity is re-added with different sort criteria after having
 * previously been removed.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Cursor-based Pagination with {@code @Query}</h2>
 *
 * <p>Cursor-based pagination involves generating and appending additional
 * restrictions involving the key fields to the <code>WHERE</code> clause of
 * the query. For this to be possible, a user-provided JDQL or JPQL query must
 * end with a <code>WHERE</code> clause to which additional conditions may be
 * appended without otherwise changing the semantics of the query:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The entire conditional expression of the <code>WHERE</code> clause must
 * be enclosed in parentheses.
 * <li>Sorting criteria must be specified independently of the user-provided
 * query, either via the {@link OrderBy} annotation or, or by passing {@link Sort}
 * criteria within the {@linkplain PageRequest#sorts() page request}.
 * </ul>
 * <p>For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Query("SELECT o FROM Customer o WHERE (o.ordersPlaced &gt;= ?1 OR o.totalSpent &gt;= ?2)")
 * &#64;OrderBy("zipcode")
 * &#64;OrderBy("birthYear")
 * &#64;OrderBy("id")
 * CursoredPage&lt;Customer&gt; getTopBuyers(int minOrders, float minSpent,
 *                                         {@code PageRequest<Customer>} pageRequest);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Only queries which return entities may be used with cursor-based pagination
 * because cursors are created from the entity attribute values that
 * form the unique key.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Page Numbers and Totals</h2>
 *
 * <p>Page numbers, total numbers of elements across all pages, and total count
 * of pages are not accurate when cursor-based pagination is used and should not be
 * relied upon.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Database Support for Cursor-based Pagination</h2>
 *
 * <p>A repository method with return type <code>CursoredPage</code> must raise
 * {@link UnsupportedOperationException} if the database itself is not capable
 * of cursor-based pagination.</p>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of elements in this slice
